# 🏛️ NFT-Based Virtual Tours: Monetizing Cultural Heritage

Welcome to an innovative Web3 platform that empowers cultural institutions, museums, and heritage sites to monetize their treasures through immersive NFT-based virtual tours! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this project addresses real-world challenges like limited funding for preservation, restricted physical access due to geography or capacity, and the need for sustainable revenue streams. By tokenizing virtual experiences and digital artifacts as NFTs, institutions can generate income while making cultural heritage globally accessible and engaging.

## ✨ Features

🌍 Create and mint NFTs for exclusive virtual tours of heritage sites  
💰 Monetize through NFT sales, royalties, and auctions  
🔒 Ownership-verified access to immersive 3D tours and AR experiences  
🎟️ Tiered access levels (e.g., basic tour vs. premium with hidden artifacts)  
🏆 Community governance for proposing and voting on new heritage sites  
📈 Royalty distribution to original creators and institutions on resales  
🎮 Gamified elements like collectible digital relics within tours  
🔄 Marketplace for trading tour NFTs and related assets  
📊 Analytics dashboard for institutions to track engagement and earnings  
🚫 Anti-fraud measures to prevent unauthorized duplication of digital assets

## 🛠 How It Works

This platform uses 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts to handle everything from NFT minting to governance and royalties, ensuring security, transparency, and decentralization on the Stacks blockchain.

### Smart Contracts Overview
1. **NFTMintContract**: Handles minting of NFTs representing virtual tours or digital artifacts, including metadata like tour details and heritage site info.  
2. **AccessControlContract**: Verifies NFT ownership to grant access to virtual tours, enforcing tiered permissions.  
3. **MarketplaceContract**: Enables buying, selling, and listing of NFTs with built-in escrow for secure trades.  
4. **RoyaltyDistributionContract**: Automatically distributes royalties (e.g., 10% of resale value) to cultural institutions and creators.  
5. **AuctionContract**: Manages timed auctions for rare or limited-edition tour NFTs, like exclusive "first visitor" editions.  
6. **GovernanceContract**: Allows NFT holders to propose and vote on new heritage sites or tour updates using a token-based voting system.  
7. **TokenContract**: Issues fungible tokens (e.g., HERITAGE tokens) for rewards, staking, or micro-payments within tours.  
8. **RegistryContract**: Maintains a registry of verified cultural institutions and sites to prevent fake entries, with admin controls for validation.

**For Cultural Institutions (Creators)**  
- Register your institution via the RegistryContract.  
- Upload virtual tour data (e.g., 3D models, AR overlays) and generate a unique hash.  
- Call NFTMintContract to mint NFTs with details like tour title, description, and access tiers.  
- Set royalties in RoyaltyDistributionContract and list on MarketplaceContract or AuctionContract.  
Boom! Your heritage site is now monetized—earn from initial sales and ongoing royalties.

**For Users (Visitors and Collectors)**  
- Browse and purchase NFTs via MarketplaceContract or bid in AuctionContract.  
- Use AccessControlContract to verify ownership and unlock the virtual tour (integrated with web/apps for immersive viewing).  
- Collect digital artifacts during tours, stake tokens in TokenContract for bonuses, or vote in GovernanceContract for community features.  
- Resell NFTs on the marketplace, with royalties automatically flowing back to creators.

**For Verifiers and Auditors**  
- Query RegistryContract to confirm authenticity of heritage sites.  
- Use get-nft-details in NFTMintContract to view ownership history and metadata.  
- Check royalty payouts via RoyaltyDistributionContract for transparency.

That's it! This project not only preserves and promotes cultural heritage but also creates a sustainable economic model, solving funding shortages while democratizing access worldwide. Get started by deploying these Clarity contracts on Stacks and building a frontend dApp for seamless user interaction.
